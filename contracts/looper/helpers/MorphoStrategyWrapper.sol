 * @dev Library for reading and writing value-types to specific transient storage slots.

 * Transient slots are often used to store temporary values that are removed after the current transaction.

 *  * Example reading and writing values using transient storage:
 * ```solidity
 * contract Lock {
 *     using TransientSlot for *;
 *
 *     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
 *     bytes32 internal constant _LOCK_SLOT = 0xf4678858b2b588224636b8522b729e7722d32fc491da849ed75b3fdf3c84f542;
